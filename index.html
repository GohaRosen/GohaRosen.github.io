<p><h1>Outline of the project (Malgorzata Rosenfeld – K00201624)</h1>

When I first read the brief I was very confused and didn’t know where to start. 
After initial confusion partially settled,   I set up the file and imported my character, that I created and animated as part of previous modules, to the stage and exported it for actionscript use. I give it a instance name and started writing some code. 
I started with event listeners for when key in pressed and released. But unfortunately I was consistently getting errors in an output panel. At this point I spent good few hours trying to detect my error but couldn’t.  I was looking at a big picture not knowing that something small like a wrong character in a wrong place can do that to your code. At this time I was suppose to  upload first version of my project to moodle so I didn’t wanted to upload something that doesn’t work so I created new file with a simple shape. I copied and modified a bit the code from my first file and to my surprise it did work with the shape. So at this point I give up on my animation and decided I’m going to continue with the shape, so I created little animation of flushing three dots on right side when the shape was moving right, and the same dots flushing on left when the shape was moving left. After I uploaded that to moodle I decided to give my original file another try. I watched some tutorials online that suggested commenting out all lines of code and starting with a trace statement to check where I made the mistake that makes my code unusable.  And so I tested if my event listeners work, and they did. Then I checked all the statements etc. until I found the problem. When my character was walking right and left and play the correct animation I added few lines of code to create a dead zone in which the character in moving. I first tried the stage.stageWidth approach but for some reason it didn’t work with my file so I did set it up manually by calculating the 25% and 75% of the stage width. Then I added collision detection with a trace statement at that point, to check if it works but also at that stage I didn’t decided yet what I want to do with it. 
Then I focused on the background. I had a lot of trouble to make it work, so I ended up with a lot of symbols in my library which was very confusing at times.  But I finally made it work with just one layer on a main timeline containing one symbol and multiple symbols inside it. 
In my process I’m referring back to class notes and also I’m heavily relying on actionscript API on Adobe website and other online resources. 
Currently I’m working on parallax and infinite scrolling.
